#Its base and height are both equal to n. It is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.
#Write a function that takes in a parameter n and prints a staircase of size n.

#2 Given a 2-dimensional array of numbers (i.e. a list of lists), write a function that returns the sum of all numbers that are low points. 
#A low point is any number that is smaller than its neighbors above, below, and to the left and right. Example:

[9, 8, 6, 5, 4]
[7, 4, 7, 7, 2]
[6, 5, 0, 5, 6]
[3, 1, 8, 5, 8]
#The red numbers are low points, so the function should return 4 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 7.
